# AirBNB Clone - Web Statics

During this project we use HTML and CSS.

## HTML

Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.

## CSS

* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
* CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
* CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
* External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
